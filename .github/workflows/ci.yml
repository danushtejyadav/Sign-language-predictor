# Name of the GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI Pipeline for Sign Language Project

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Also triggers on pull requests targeting the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build-and-test"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a Python environment for use in actions
      - name: Set up Python 3.12
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      # Step 3: Installs the project dependencies from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Create dummy data to allow the training script to run
      # We do this because the actual 'data/raw' folder is not (and should not be) committed to Git.
      - name: Create dummy data for CI test
        run: |
          mkdir -p data/raw/SIGN_A data/raw/SIGN_B
          python -c "import json; data = [[0.0]*186]*45; \
            with open('data/raw/SIGN_A/0.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f); \
            with open('data/raw/SIGN_A/1.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f); \
            with open('data/raw/SIGN_B/0.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f); \
            with open('data/raw/SIGN_B/1.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f);"

      # Step 5: Run the training script as a "smoke test"
      # This doesn't check for model accuracy, but it ensures the script runs without errors.
      - name: Run training script (smoke test)
        run: python src/train.py
