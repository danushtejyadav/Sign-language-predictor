# Do not commit raw or processed data. These should be managed separately.

# Use a .gitkeep file if you want to commit the empty directories:
# e.g., create an empty file at data/raw/.gitkeep
# !data/raw/.gitkeep
# !data/processed/.gitkeep

# Model Artifacts
# Models are outputs of the training script and should not be versioned in Git.
# They should be tracked via MLflow or another artifact registry.
